Traffic report for sproutwellaba.com.

    tools/traffic.sh            # today
    tools/traffic.sh 2          # last 2 days
    tools/traffic.sh 7 --bots   # last week, plus crawler activity
    tools/traffic.sh 1 --internal  # include your own flagged visits

Humans only by default. "Human" means: the user-agent wasn't recognised as a
bot AND the visit wasn't flagged internal (visit any page once with
?internal=1 to flag your own browser). Bots are recorded rather than dropped,
so this is a filter and not a gap in the data.

One caveat the numbers carry honestly: the visitor id is re-salted every night
so nobody can be followed across days. Within one day a person is counted once;
across a range, somebody who came back on two days counts twice. That is the
price of not tracking people, and it is stated in the output.
